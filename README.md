## 💡 Tech Philosophy  

> “Sometimes it needs to work before being perfect.”  

I believe in **shipping secure systems that evolve**, not delaying progress for theoretical perfection.  
Good security engineering is pragmatic — it enables velocity, scales through automation, and learns from iteration.  
Whether it's automating detections, hardening infrastructure, or reviewing IaC changes, my goal is to make **security invisible but indispensable**.

---

## 🧱 Infrastructure as Code  

I work closely with Terraform-based infrastructure, interacting daily with modules for **S3**, **IAM roles**, **CloudFront**, and **Cloudflare**. While I’m not the owner of our Terraform environment, I play a key role in ensuring **security and compliance standards** across all IaC deployments.  
- Assisted in **multi-region AWS environment orchestration** and resource imports.  
- Conducted **code reviews** for IAM-related pull requests to enforce least-privilege access.  
- Ensured **encryption and baseline security standards** are met across AWS resources.

## 🔒 Security Engineering  

Security is at the center of my work. I specialize in embedding **detection, automation, and policy enforcement** directly into engineering workflows to enable **proactive threat detection and response**.  
- Strengthened **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** and improved IAM role hygiene.  
- Developed a dedicated **Detection as Code (DaC)** repository with CI validators that synchronize detections with the **SIEM pipeline**.  
- Implemented **open-source vulnerability management** tooling and built an **incident response (IR)** framework — defining SEV levels, automating alerting, and operationalizing response playbooks.  
- Leveraged **GitHub’s native security features** (branch protection rules, commit signing, secret scanning) to enforce a **secure-by-default** development culture.

## ⚙️ DevOps & Automation  

My focus lies in **security automation** and **CI/CD integration**, bringing bots and AI into development workflows to enhance assurance without slowing delivery.  
- Built and maintained **security scanning pipelines** using **GitHub Actions** and **CircleCI**.  
- Created **bots for automated commit signing** and branch protection enforcement.  
- Introduced **AI-assisted validation and review systems**, pairing automation with human approval for high-value changes.  
- Contributed to **infrastructure and configuration testing**, improving consistency and compliance coverage.

## 📊 Data Engineering  

Experience in **security telemetry** and **data ingestion** workflows — particularly in operationalizing event streams for security visibility.
- Worked with **telemetry data** for event correlation and monitoring.  
- Focused on **data integrity**, **access control**, and **security compliance** across analytics pipelines.

## 🔍 Current Focus  

🎯 **Product Security** – Establishing end-to-end security coverage across the entire product lifecycle, from design and development to deployment and operations.  
⚙️ **SecOps Pipeline Maturity** – Evolving detection, response, and automation pipelines to improve speed, coverage, and resilience.  
🤖 **Security Automation** – Scaling security initiatives by automating policy enforcement, monitoring, and response workflows.
